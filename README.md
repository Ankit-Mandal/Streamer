# Streamer

Built with React.js, this is a web app where users can view, create, edit, and delete a video stream they created, by making 
REST API calls to the back-end database (simulated by using JSONserver).

Here, we have utilized the OAuth API from Google Cloud, to authenticate users for logging into the application.

# Languages and Tools used  - 
React, Node.js, Redux, React-Final-Form, React-Router, Google OAuth API (Google Cloud), 
JSON-server, Semantic UI
